* Multiple Lattices
-- send and receive operations

* MDWF - start from clover, add a vector of fermions as input to ops and invs.

* Multi and part files for qdpcc and ddpairs

? Extend QDP I/O interface to handle both double and single preicision
? Extend QDP/C I/O to handle sections:

    W:ColorVector(V, "foo", {0,1,2,3}, {5,6,4,L[3]-1})

  while keeping

    W:ColorVector(V, "foo")

  equivalent to

    W:ColorVector(V, "foo", {0,...}, {L[0] - 1, ...})

   This will allow implemnting DD pairs writer in the QLUA space.
   (with a lot copying though.)
