This tutorial contains two runnable scripts. Saying

  $ qlua lattice.qlua make-input.qlua

will generate file input-file in the current directory. This file is used by
the second script, qio-example.qlua, which could be ran as follows:

  $ qlua lattice.qlua qio-example.qlua

Notice that lattice.qlua is used in both runs, so one needs to edit place
only to change lattice geometry.
