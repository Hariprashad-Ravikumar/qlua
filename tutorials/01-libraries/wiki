QLUA uses LUA's module management system. For in-depth discussion, see [http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.3 modules section] of LUA documentation.

When QLUA is built, the installation path is stored in the executable and the package search path, which at the program start is effectively set as if the following code is executed:

  package.path = "./?.qlua;&lt;INSTALL_TOP&gt;/lib/qlua;./qlib/?.qlua"

Installation process copies some useful packages into <code>&lt;INSTALL_TOP&gt;/lib/qlib</code>, consult your local setup for available functionality.

The LUA module system ensures that a module is loaded at most once, so saying

  require "some-module"
  require "some-module"

will only load <code>some-module.qlua</code> once.

A missing module is treated as an error by QLUA runtime: it reports an error and exits with a non-zero exit code.
