Currently, <code>qlib</code> contains implementations of three smearing operations. In all cases one can restrict the amount of computation performed by proper use of subset. See the [[QLUA Tutorial:Subsets|subset tutorial]] for details. In the default case the whole lattice is used.
= HEX smearing=
If you say
  require "hex-smear"
an implementation of the BMW HEX smearing will be loaded into QLUA. The function
  V = bmw_hex(L, U)
makes one HEX smearing step as described in Stefan's notes. BMW use to smearing steps it their action, so we can construct the gauge field suitable for the Clover Dirac operator by saying
  U_smeared = bmw_hex(L, bmw_hex(L, U))
= APE smearing=
For the APE smearing the code is loaded with
  requre "ape-smear"
The implementation follows Sergey's extract from Chroma and has the following calling conventions:
  V = APE_smear(U, alpha, N, accu, imax, axis)
The smearing is not perform for the links along the <code>axis</code>, which is 0-based. Other parameters are have the same meaning as in Chroma.
= Wuppertal smearing=
Here we follow the Chroma conventions again. The smearing is always applied to either a color vector, a dirac fermion, or a dirac propagator. One uses the same routine in all three cases.
  require "wuppertal-smear"
  V = wuppertal_smear(U, alpha, N, F, axis)
Here <code>F</code> is the matter lattice field to be smeared.
